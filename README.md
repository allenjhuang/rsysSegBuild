# rsysSegBuild.js
Builds a segmentation dashboard in Responsys Interact.
Last tested on Firefox to be working 12/1/2019.

Inspired by Justin Hilborn's segmentation dashboard bookmarklet.

## Usage
1. Tailor the config at the beginning of the script to your campaign.
2. Go to Responsys Interact's navigation sidebar -> Data -> Manage Lists -> Create or edit a segmentation dashboard -> Segments -> Rules.
3. Open up the browser's web console (CTRL + Shift + K on Firefox).
4. Run this script by copying and pasting this whole script into the web console.
5. Check to see if the rules were added correctly.

- Best to navigate away from the page (for example: click on Folders in the navigation sidebar) to clean up if there was an error.

## Todo
1. Documentation
2. Support opening segmentation dashboard from folder view
